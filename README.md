# Flask-Study

## Description
This repository contains my practice projects while learning Flask.  
The goal is to gradually build up from basic route handling to full-stack web applications using Flask.

## Current Progress
- Basic Flask app structure setup
- Creating multiple routes (`/`, `/about`, `/contact`)
- Building forms and handling POST requests
- Applying CSS directly inside Flask
- Separating HTML templates using `render_template()`
- Uploading versions to GitHub for version control

## Project Structure
- /Form in put handling practice/
- /Flask-Practice-(HTML in here)/
- /Flask-Practice-(connected HTML)/

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Flask
- HTML, CSS

## Future Plans
- Handling GET/POST separately
- Passing variables into templates
- Creating reusable templates with Jinja2
- Deploying Flask apps to production environments

## Note
This repository documents the entire journey of mastering Flask, step by step, starting from the basics to building complete web applications.
